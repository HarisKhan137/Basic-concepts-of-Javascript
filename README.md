# Basic-concepts-of-Javascript
Codes related to basic JS concepts of Javascript syntax, variables, functions, conditional structures, loops/iterations etc  
**JS1**
The code is basically about declaring a variable with no initial value and then running it through a loop resulting in value change. The concepts of functions, conditional statemets and loops have been  used.
The function is declared in the first step.
A variable is declared in the function with an initial value of undefined and that value is printed # in JS, undefined is treated as a value for a variale if no assignment is made to it.
The variable is iterated through a for loop with a change of value from firstly undefined, then 0 uptil 4.
On each iteration, the variable undergoes an if condition, which is'nt satisfied as the it has a defined value, so else is executed.
After execution of else statement  for 5 times, the loop ends.
After the loop ends, a line of code is executed after that.
The function is closed and called in the next step.
As soon as the function is called, the whole code inside it is executed in real terms on the screen.
The function can also be called before even declaring the function, because js initializes it at the start of the code and looks for the function throughout the whole code, the moment it is called.
